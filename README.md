# Crop Yield Prediction Project  

**Project Overview**
  
The Crop Yield Prediction Project aims to predict crop yields based on environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and soil quality, as well as agricultural practices like fertilizer use and irrigation. This analysis empowers farmers with actionable insights to optimize farming decisions and improve overall efficiency in agricultural production.  

 **Business Objective**
  
The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts crop yields using historical agricultural and environmental data. By achieving this, the project aims to:  
- Assist farmers in making data-driven decisions.  
- Optimize resource allocation such as fertilizer and water usage.  
- Improve crop productivity and reduce waste.  
- Address food security challenges by enhancing agricultural planning.

### Data Analysis and Methodology  

#### Dataset Preparation  
- Historical data on crop yields and environmental conditions is collected, including factors such as temperature, soil moisture, and rainfall patterns.  
- The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values and outliers to ensure reliable analysis.  

#### Feature Engineering  
- Key factors influencing crop yield are identified through exploratory analysis.  
- Categorical data is transformed into numerical formats where applicable to make it compatible with machine learning models.

#### Model Selection  
- Machine learning algorithms, including **Decision Trees**, **Random Forests**, and **Linear Regression**, are tested for their effectiveness.  
- Models are evaluated based on accuracy and their relevance to agricultural datasets.  

#### Training and Testing  
- The dataset is split into **training** and **testing subsets** to validate model performance.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** is conducted to enhance prediction accuracy.  

#### Visualization  
- Visual insights such as yield patterns by region or crop type are created using graphs and heatmaps to aid stakeholders in understanding the data.  
- NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) imagery is used to monitor regional crop health.
